# Email Sequence Builder

Email Sequence Builder is a drag-and-drop automation platform that lets marketers create sophisticated email drip campaigns without writing code or managing complex ESP settings. The platform features a visual canvas for designing multi-branch email sequences triggered by user behavior (opens, clicks, purchases, inactivity), with built-in AI-powered copywriting assistance and A/B testing capabilities. Users can import contacts from any source, design emails with a template library, and set up conditional logic that personalizes message flow for each subscriber. The platform connects to major email service providers (Mailchimp, SendGrid, etc.) via API but adds an intelligence layer that optimizes send times and content based on engagement patterns. Revenue streams include monthly subscriptions starting at $79 for up to 10,000 contacts, scaling to enterprise plans at $599+ for unlimited contacts and advanced features like predictive analytics and custom integrations. Additional income from template marketplace (designers sell pre-built sequences for $29-$99, platform takes 40% commission).
